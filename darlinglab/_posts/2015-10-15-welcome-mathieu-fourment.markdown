Welcome Mathieu Fourment! Mathieu Fourment has joined our group as a postdoc, and brings expertise on phylogenetic methods applied to infectious disease.
Mathieu comes to us from Sydney Uni where he worked closely with [Eddie Holmes](http://sydney.edu.au/science/people/edward.holmes.php). He has published on methods to infer rate variation in phylogenies, and developed the [Physher software](https://code.google.com/p/physher/) to implement those (and other) models. He has [published extensively](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=dUOgPoYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on other topics, and has [developed other software](https://github.com/4ment).

As we continue to grow the [AusGEM](http://ausgem.org) initiative phylogenetics will be an integral part of what we do, so stay tuned for more great work from Mathieu and the collaborations that emerge with him in the group.
