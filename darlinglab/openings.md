We are always seeking people who are passionate about using computational and statistical methods to help unravel the forces of genome evolution. The Darling lab at UTS is located in the ithree institute, in close proximity with experts in microbiology, molecular biology, and mathematical statistics, creating a fertile cross-disciplinary environment.

### Ph.D. fellowships
An opportunity exists for a Ph.D. student with a strong computational or statistical background to develop new and efficient inference techniques for complex phylogenetic network models.

### UTS Chancellor's postdoctoral fellowships
The University provides a [fellowship scheme](http://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/future-researchers/future-research-staff/chancellors-postdoctoral-fellowships) to support exceptional early career researchers in all areas. These are highly competitive positions intended to bridge the gap between postdoctoral and faculty level positions. Applications are typically due on an annual basis in May of each year. Nomination of a mentor at UTS is required, please contact me if you would like to discuss further.
