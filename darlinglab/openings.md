We are always seeking people who are passionate about using computational and statistical methods to help unravel the forces of genome evolution. The Darling lab at UTS is located in the ithree institute, in close proximity with experts in microbiology, molecular biology, and mathematical statistics, creating a fertile cross-disciplinary environment.

### Ph.D. fellowships
An opportunity exists for a Ph.D. student to investigate the evolution and ecology of antibiotic resistance linked with plasmids and integrons. This could involve learning and developing new molecular and computational inference methods.

Interested? [Contact Aaron](/people).
