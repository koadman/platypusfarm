After installing Mauve, we suggest subscribing to the [mauve-announce](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mauve-announce) and [mauve-users](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mauve-users) mailing lists. The mauve-announce mailing list is a low-traffic list on which we make announcements about new software versions with bug fixes and new features. The mauve-users list is a general discussion forum for users of the Mauve software to communicate with each other and resolve usage issues.
