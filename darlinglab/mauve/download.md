### Downloading Mauve

Mauve is free of charge, open-source software licensed under the GNU GPL.

The current version of Mauve is 2.4.0, released on December 21st 2014.
The 2.x release series incorporates an accurate new alignment algorithm called progressiveMauve. For a more comprehensive list of changes and new features, see the [Mauve version history](user-guide/versions.html).
Unfortunately the 2.4.0 release has a buggy interaction with the boost C++ libraries that causes frequent crashes, therefore it is suggested that the development snapshots linked below be used until the next release. Mauve 2.4.0 can still be found in the release archive linked below.

### Documentation

We provide a [Mauve User's Guide](user-guide/introduction.html) containing detailed information on how to operate the Mauve software.

### Support

After installing Mauve, we suggest subscribing to the [mauve-announce](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mauve-announce) and [mauve-users](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mauve-users) mailing lists. The mauve-announce mailing list is a low-traffic list on which we make announcements about new software versions with bug fixes and new features. The mauve-users list is a general discussion forum for users of the Mauve software to communicate with each other and resolve usage issues.

Prior to posting a usage-related question about Mauve to the mauve-users list, please search the [mauve-users list archives](https://sourceforge.net/p/mauve/mailman/mauve-users/) for previous discussion related to the topic. Try google. **Your question may already have been answered.**
