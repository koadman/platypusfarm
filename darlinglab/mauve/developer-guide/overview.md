### Mauve Development Overview
The developer's guide contains instructions for compiling the command-line alignment software for both Windows and unix-like systems.

The Mauve graphical interface is written in Java and can be compiled on any system with an installed Java Development Kit.

Windows releases are packaged with the [Nullsoft Scriptable Installer System](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) to produce an installer binary.

#### Source code 

The Mauve source code is licensed freely under the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
Mauve source code is available from the [github repository](https://github.com/koadman/mauve). Note that some of the development history from the project's inception in 2001 to 2006 was lost in a previous source code repository migration.

#### API documentation 

The source code contains doxygen format API documentation. The API documentation can be generated by running the command:

`doxygen projects/[doxyfile]`

from the top-level directory of any source package.
